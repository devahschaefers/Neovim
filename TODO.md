Somehow get notified if there are errors in other files through the lsp

Latex support  https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1fqvbfb/neovim_as_a_latex_editor/
- preview pdf 
- lsp (ish) support autocomplete, syntax highlighting, snippets!

Make hover better, it should exit when pressing escape or maybe even any key but it a bit hard to get rid of right now (right now doesnt even quit on `q` you have to move of the hover item)

Easy way to show full length file path in statusline (togglable ideally since some files paths can be long and should only be shown when not known)

Easy way to highlight all

easier way to create files without having to open up nvim tree

fix telescope (doesnt seem to work with .gitignore maybe other hidden files too)
 - this issue of hidden files also happens in nvim-tree making it hard to access hidden files

dont gray out text that is not used in a file, its annyoing when you are writing code that will have a use later but not now and you lose all syntax highlighting
